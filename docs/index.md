::: tip RULES
These rules are subject to change as I discover more about my rp preferences. For now, here's what I got:
1. Please be 18+
2. No one-liners or \*action\* writers.
3. I'm a slow writer and I get sidetracked pretty often, so please have mercy on me. If I haven't replied to a thread in a few days you can send me a reminder on the 3rd day.
4. There will sometimes be written depictions of violence between characters in this blog (combat, war, etc), so beware if you'd rather not see that. I'll do my best to tag them, but I can't promise that I won't miss one occasionally.
5. If you have any issues with me or with something I wrote, bring it up and let me know personally. We can work out our issues like responsible adults.
6. I'm open to writing platonic, familial and romantic relationships between OCs and CCs.
7. I'm open to crossovers.
